# Wachadoin

Wachadoin is a progressive web app (PWA) that brings friend groups together for quick, casual meetups—without the heavy
lifting of traditional scheduling tools. Think coffee runs, impromptu bike rides, or a mom’s group catch-up, all
starting in under an hour. If you’re tired of bloated apps and just want to ping nearby pals for a spontaneous hangout,
this is for you.

## Who’s It For?

- People who love low-commitment, real-time socializing.
- Friends or groups (e.g., “Mom’s Group,” “Bike Group,” “Coffee Shop Group”) seeking short, fun meetups.
- Anyone who wants connection without the calendar chaos.

## Features

- **Low Friction**: Jump in and send an alert in seconds—no complex setup.
- **Quick Meetups**: Events last under an hour and start within 60 minutes.
- **Activity Groups**: Join or create circles like “Bike Group” or “Coffee Shop Gang” for targeted invites.
- **Nearby Alerts**: See what’s happening close by, right now.

## Tech Stack

- NextJS + TailwindCSS for a snappy, responsive PWA.
- Firebase for auth, hosting, and real-time data.
