Future plans to enhance or improve Wach'aDoin. Put future plans here so they are
not forgotten, but also so side ideas do not derail the main effort(s).

## Security

- [ ] 
  Implement [CSRF](https://medium.com/@mmalishshrestha/implementing-csrf-protection-in-next-js-applications-9a29d137a12d)
    - [CSRF NMP Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csrf)

> #### CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgety)
> Need to avoid someone being able to hijack a user's session and use that
> session to invoke operations. Need to do that utilizing CSFR (Cross Site Request Forgery).

## DX (Developer Experience)

- [ ] User/Profile [context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context))
- [ ] Add/Enhance [chained middleware](https://www.58bits.com/blog/chaining-or-combining-nextjs-middleware)

> #### Chained Middleware
> Middleware as a request/response filter is useful for many things but NextJS only allows the creation of a single
> middleware.[ts|js] file. To overcome this limitation, need to create a solution to chain middleware.

## Monetize
